- 👋 Hi, I’m @tuemaytinh1981
- 👀 I’m interested in Technologies
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, Firebase, NodeJs. I have written a lot of software. Right now I'm focusing on a new programming technology, based on Dart, where Flutter writes cross-platform apps.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate online to build a cross-platform open community, regardless of platform or proprietary restriction. Working together to make money and develop the community.
